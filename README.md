# -Molecular-Activity-Classifier-
Repository includes an ML pipeline to predict pharmacological metrics (IC50, CC50, SI) of molecules. Uses XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and visualizations (PCA, UMAP, SHAP) for data analysis and interpretation. Accelerates drug candidate screening.

## Why This Project Matters for Chemistry  

This project bridges the gap between chemistry and machine learning by enabling rapid, data-driven predictions of molecular activity (IC50), toxicity (CC50), and selectivity (SI). Instead of relying solely on costly and time-consuming lab experiments, we use molecular descriptors — numerical representations of chemical structure, such as electronic properties, molecular weight, and topological indices — to build predictive models.  

These models help chemists identify promising compounds for antiviral or pharmaceutical research faster and more efficiently. By understanding which molecular features (e.g., PEOE_VSA, BCUT2D, BalabanJ) drive activity or toxicity, we empower rational design of safer and more effective molecules. This accelerates the drug discovery process and helps allocate resources to the most promising candidates.  

In summary, our project demonstrates how machine learning can transform chemical research, offering actionable insights that support smarter, faster, and more cost-effective development of new therapeutic compounds.
